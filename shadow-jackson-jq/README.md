# shadow-jackson-jq

* This directory contains dependencies for [eiiches/jackson-jq](https://github.com/eiiches/jackson-jq).
* [eiiches/jackson-jq](https://github.com/eiiches/jackson-jq) has a newer dependency on jackson compared to Embulk.
* Therefore, I created a shaded-jar once to use it with Embulk.
